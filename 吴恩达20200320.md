# Machine Learning
    -Grew out of work in AI
    -New Capability for computers
## Examples:
    -Database mining
    - Application can't program by hand
    - Self-customizing programs
    - Understanding huamn learning
## Machine learning definition
    Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly progeammed
    A computer programe is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P,if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
##  Machine learning algorithms:
    -Supervised learning
    -Unsupervised learning 计算机自己学习
    -Reinforcement learning
    -Recommender systems.
    -practical advice for learning algorithms
